# p5js-Projects
You can find the accompanying code for my tutorial videos on YouTube by searching here.  Most sketches involve the use of beginner-level,
procedures and methods (from a hobby-codist's/artist's perspective) to make modifications easier for generating artistic expressions.  You can find examples for creating a variety of movement types (such as Brownian, Levy Flight, Linear Interpolation and Perlin Noise).  In addition, I provide coding techniques for creating particle systems, arrays of objects, recursions and computational geometries.
This repository is provided as a resource for acedemics, artists, coders and others who may be interested in coding procedures for creating
generative art.  These are all free to use, copy, distribute and modify.  As an additional resource, some programs have an accompanying video
explaining in detail the procedures involved.

Videos are available at YouTube on the Draw Make & Code channel: https://www.youtube.com/drawmakecode

To access the code directly, use the p5.js editor.  Visit my account and access my sketches here:
