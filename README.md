# p5js-Projects
You can find the accompanying code for my tutorial videos on YouTube by searching here.
This repository is provided as a resource for acedemics, artists, coders and others who may be interested in coding procedures for creating
generative art.  These are all free to use, copy, distribute and modify.  

To access the code directly, use the p5.js editor.  Visit my account and access my sketches here:
