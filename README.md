You can find the accompanying code for my tutorial videos on YouTube by searching here.
This repository is provided as a resource for acedemics, artists, coders and others who may be interested in coding procedures for creating
generative art.  These are all free to use, copy, distribute and modify.  


Artist's Biography:
I've been coding since the mid 1980's as a hobby.  I was making generative art before it really even had a name.  Decades later,
I'm still learning how to program in modern languages and scripts so I can continue to make amazing art using logic and
procedures.  As an interdisciplinary, materials and digital artist, I draw upon a variety of acedemics to create thoughtful works of art.  From
classical media and subjects to computational geometry using data sets, my work showcases a thoughtful approach to expression.
Acedemically, I have a concentration of study in linear and finite math dealing in probabilities and statistics.
My formal degree is in business, but my heart and soul is that of an artist.  Find examples of my work on YouTube at Draw Make Code, or
on Facebook at Ed Cavett.
