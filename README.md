# p5js-Projects
I've been coding since the mid 1980's as a hobby.  I was making generative art before it even had a name.  Decades later,
I'm still learning how to program in modern languages and scripts so I can continue to make amazing art using logic and
procedures.  As an inter-disciplinary artist, I draw upon a variety of acedemics to create thoughtful works of art.  From
classic media and subjects to computational geometry using data sets, my work showcases a thoughtful approach to expression.
Acedemically, I have a concentration of study in linear and finite math dealing in probabilities and statistics.
My formal degree is in business, but heart and soul is that of an artist.
